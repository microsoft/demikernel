_Demikernel_ is a library operating system (LibOS) architecture designed for use
with kernel-bypass I/O devices. This architecture offers a uniform system call
API across kernel-bypass technologies (e.g., RDMA, DPDK) and OS functionality
(e.g., a user-level networking stack for DPDK).

To read more about the motivation behind the _Demikernel_, check out this
[blog post](http://irenezhang.net/blog/2019/05/21/demikernel.html).
